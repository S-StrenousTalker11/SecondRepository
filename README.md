# Second Repository.

This is my second repository.
I created this repository locally in my computer and pushed it onto GitHub.

In the process of pushing this local repo, I learnt:

 - git remote add origin <link> - Connecting the local project to the repository on GitHub.
   The steps I followed were:
    1. Create an empty repository with the same name as the local project on GitHub.
    2. Navigate to the local project directory in the terminal.
    3. Run the above command.
    4. Copy the link of the repository on GitHub to the terminal and paste it after origin.
    5. Press Enter to complete the process.

- git remote -v - Checking the connection to the repository on GitHub.
- git branch - Gives the current branch name.
- git branch -M <BranchName> - Renaming the branch.
- git push origin main - Pushing the local repo to the repository on GitHub.
    - Before doing this, all the files in this project must be added and committed.
- git commit -am "message" - Adding and committing the changes at the same time.
